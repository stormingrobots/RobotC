This group of robotC code is to help you understand how to incoporate: 
- NXT color on NXT
- EV3 color on EV3

or 

If you are working on either EV3 or NXT, and would like to have a single file to toggle back and forth by simply switch platform, you should use: 
 colorBasic-nxt-ev3-struct.c
or 
 colorBasic-nxt-ev3-array.c 
 
 They both show you how to do that by using ether array or struct style.
